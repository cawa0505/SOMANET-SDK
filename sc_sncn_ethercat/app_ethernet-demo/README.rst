Low Level Ethernet Demo
=======================

:scope: Example
:description: A simple demo of using the low level ethernet module
:keywords: ethernet, mac, mii

This demo shows the use of the low level mac by implementing a simple
IP stack capable of responding to a ICMP ping message.

This demo is adapted to work with EoE as MII layer instead of direct hardware
connection. The working demo is a stepstone for the final xtcp integration.
